	<hr/>

	<p style="text-align: center; color: #760500;"> Greeting and salutations, my name is <i> Chilli </i>. Within the myriad collective of people around the world cascades various <b>points of views</b>. These views are honed from the <mark> nature
	of the world around them</mark> and how an accumulation of anguish may transcend into the artistic plane of existence. </p>

		<h2  style="text-align: center; color: #760500;">A Short Poem (a starter, if you may).</h2>
			
				<pre> 
		Whose woods these are I think I know.   
		His house is in the village though;   
		He will not see me stopping here   
		To watch his woods fill up with snow.   

		My little horse must think it queer   
		To stop without a farmhouse near   
		Between the woods and frozen lake   
		The darkest evening of the year.   

		He gives his harness bells a shake   
		To ask if there is some mistake.   
		The only other soundâ€™s the sweep   
		Of easy wind and downy flake.   

		The woods are lovely, dark and deep,   
		But I have promises to keep,   
		And miles to go before I sleep,   
		And miles to go before I sleep.

		-Robert Frost

		<p> The short poem accumulates the anguish one may face in a <strong>life of struggle</strong>, this boils down to representing death as a form of peace and rest. This, however, lies null as life goes on and on. </p>
